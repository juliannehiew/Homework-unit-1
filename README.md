* When was the company incorporated?

Betterment was launched in 2008 and started taking investor money in 2010, during the height of Great Recession (Investopedia). 



* Who are the founders of the company?

Founders are Jon Stein, a former banking consultant started Betterment when he was just 28, and Co-founder, Eli Broverman, who was at that time a securities lawyer and is now the President of Betterment (Betterment).



* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The idea was stemmed from Jon’s frustrations with managing his money online, noticing that Vanguard or ING Direct offered very poor interfaces and charged outrageous account keeping fees.

Being graduated from Harvard in Economics and having worked in the finance industry, Jon planned to develop Betterment.  His first business plan had no employees and thought of building Betterment all by himself that includes coding the site, marketing, managing customer service, and designing.  When he shared this idea with roommate, Sean Owen, who was a software engineer at Google, Jon was hoping that Sean was a keen in validating this idea.  Not knowing how coding works, Jon perceived coding as a foreign world.  Instead of learning from scratch, he seeks Sean’s expertise and guidance to build the backend capabilities.  As Sean was excited with this idea, he helped setting up Apache and Tomcat servers with an Adobe Flash and Flex-based front-end design for the website, along with building MySQL database, and a Java application.

Simultaneously, Jon focused on front end of Betterment by learning the insights of regulatory landscape.  Given the complexity of the regulations of financial instruments, he purchased a legal library and anticipated to understand the legal opportunities and risks of various structures within the investing industries. 

Then, Eli Broverman, a securities attorney whom Jon met over regular poker games, also shared the same passive, goal-based, and automated investing philosophy became the co-founder of Betterment.  In 2008, the team behind Betterment was comprised of Jon the Founder , Sean the genius engineer, Eli the entrepreneur lawyer, and Polina the graphic designer.  

Betterment’s team continued to expand when Ryan O’Sullivan, known as a serial entrepreneur, believed in the market opportunity, had tactfully connected the team to the right people to establish Betterment’s broker-dealer operation.   With a talented team and all necessary agreements in place, Betterment LLC was officially incorporated.

To date, Betterment is known as the largest independent robo-advisor in the Asset and Investment Management sector.

Besides this, the goal forecaster tool enables inexperienced investors to foresee how wealth is built when funds are invested over the long term.    



* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

The company is ranked as the best robo-advisor due to its sophisticated and highly functional investing platform utilising a combination of Applications and tools, such as Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Google Cloud Platform, just to name a few (Stackshare).
In addition to forward-thinking, Betterment is committed to continuous technological innovation to make investing easy and more accessible, or risk being left behind. One of its strengths is removing hassle for investors upon making deposit.  Adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI), the algorithm will automatically invest the deposit in the market, continually monitor the funds including automating the deposits on a preferred schedule, automatic rebalancing is triggered whenever the porfolio drifts past 3%,  and managing the investor’s portfolio at a fraction of the cost of a traditional advisor.  For instance, customers money is automatically invested according to a series of algorithms set by the brokerage (Betterment).   

Furthermore, a cash analysis is run daily to scan the checking account to align with the lower and upper bounds balance.   The two-way sweep feature is triggered if there is extra cash idling in the checking account and will automatically transfer to the Cash Reserve, a high-yield cash account, and back as when required seamlessly.  Customers will be notified via email before a sweep proceeds, so that the customer has the option to cancel it before the automation occurs.  As such,   Betterment has redefine investing by building the most customer-centric smart money manager which a traditional bank does not have such advance technology in this context.

Besides this, at the digital platforms the robo-advisors provide algorithm-driven financial planning services with minimum to no human interaction.  For the robots to operate, initial information is collected from clients to understand their financial situation and achieve future goals through an online survey.   Parameters, such as customers risk tolerance, investments goals and income are input into the machine and the AI will select one of the six appropriate investment portfolios that best match the customers risk profile, timeline and goals.  

Another useful instrument is the automated tax tools that minimise paying unnecessary taxes.  This tax smart technology develops tax-saving strategies, such as asset location and tax loss harvesting.
