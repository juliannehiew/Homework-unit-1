* When was the company incorporated?

Betterment was launched in 2008 and started taking investor money in 2010, during the height of Great Recession (Investopedia). 


* Who are the founders of the company?

Founders are Jon Stein, a former banking consultant started Betterment when he was just 28, and Co-founder, Eli Broverman, who was at that time a securities lawyer and is now the President of Betterment (Betterment).


* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The idea was stemmed from Jon’s frustrations with managing his money online, noticing that Vanguard or ING Direct offered very poor interfaces and charged outrageous account keeping fees.

Being graduated from Harvard in Economics and having worked in the finance industry, Jon planned to develop Betterment.  His first business plan had no employees and thought of building Betterment all by himself that includes coding the site, marketing, managing customer service, and designing.  When he shared this idea with roommate, Sean Owen, who was a software engineer at Google, Jon was hoping that Sean was a keen in validating this idea.  Not knowing how coding works, Jon perceived coding as a foreign world.  Instead of learning from scratch, he seeks Sean’s expertise and guidance to build the backend capabilities.  As Sean was excited with this idea, he helped setting up Apache and Tomcat servers with an Adobe Flash and Flex-based front-end design for the website, along with building MySQL database, and a Java application.

Simultaneously, Jon focused on front end of Betterment by learning the insights of regulatory landscape.  Given the complexity of the regulations of financial instruments, he purchased a legal library and anticipated to understand the legal opportunities and risks of various structures within the investing industries. 

Then, Eli Broverman, a securities attorney whom Jon met over regular poker games, also shared the same passive, goal-based, and automated investing philosophy became the co-founder of Betterment.  In 2008, the team behind Betterment was comprised of Jon the Founder , Sean the genius engineer, Eli the entrepreneur lawyer, and Polina the graphic designer.  

Betterment’s team continued to expand when Ryan O’Sullivan, known as a serial entrepreneur, believed in the market opportunity, had tactfully connected the team to the right people to establish Betterment’s broker-dealer operation.   With a talented team and all necessary agreements in place, Betterment LLC was officially incorporated.

To date, Betterment is known as the largest independent robo-advisor in the Asset and Investment Management sector. 


* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Betterment has historically raised $435.4M in funding since founded in 2008.  It has participated 10 rounds in funding and a recent funding was raised in September 2021 for a total of $100M (Owler).  Recently, it has acquired two companies, including impulsesave and Canada-based Wealthsimple’s United States book of business that will be added to Betterment’s $28 billion in total assets across its multiple business lines of financial operations.  According to PitchBook, its latest valuation is $800 million (Forbes).
